# Finance Tracker
Simple Finance Tracker which you can host yourself. It uses
Django on the Backend with Bootstrap 5 in the Frontend. 

## Setup 
At first clone the Repo and make a new Python Virtual Environment.
```
git clone https://github.com/Skzter/FinanzenTracker.git
cd FinanzenTracker
python3 -m venv ~/path/to/venv
source ~/path/to/venv/bin/activate
```
You can check if your virtual environment uses the correct python with `which python`.
It should return `your/home/path/to/env/bin/python`.
Now install Django with Pip.
```
pip install django
```
If everything worked you should be able to run `python manage.py runserver` without any issues.
If thats the case press "CTRL+C" to exit and run `python data.py` to populate the database with some test data.
Now you run `python manage.py runserver` and everything should run smoothly. Visit the adress given by 
django in your browser and you will see the finance tracker and can play around with it and try it out.
